# Timestop

This mod stops the flow of time whenever the user enters certain locations.

The mod configuration allows for time to stop whenever the user enters:

- Temples and Boss Rooms
- Temples, Boss Rooms and mini-dungeons (such as Ikana Castle, the Well and Pirate's Fortress)

The config also allows for this to be disabled. If changing the config, you may have to reload the area/scene for the time to start flowing again.
